	<p>Koduri Srisaila Sri Rajamouli (/ˈrɑːdʒəmaʊlɪ/ RAH-jə-mow-li; born 10 October 1973) is an Indian film director and screenwriter who primarily works in Telugu cinema. He is the highest paid director in India,[3][4][5] and is popular for his action, fantasy, and epic genre films. Three of his films, Baahubali: The Beginning (2015), Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), and RRR (2022) are among the top five highest grossing-films in India to date. All three films were also the most expensive Indian films ever made at the time of their release. He is a recipient of various awards including three National Film Awards, four Filmfare Awards South, and five Nandi Awards. In 2016, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, for his contributions to the field of Art.

Rajamouli has directed twelve feature films so far, and all of them were successful at the box office.[6][7][8] Baahubali 2 is currently the highest grossing film in India, and sold over 10 crore (100 million) tickets during its box office run; the highest estimated admissions for any film in India since Sholay (1975).[9][10] The 2009 fantasy action film Magadheera was the highest-grossing Telugu film ever at the time.[11][12] His 2012 film Eega won the Most Original Film at the 8th Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Baahubali films have received six Saturn Award nominations, with Baahubali 2 winning the Best International Film. RRR is nominated in three categories at the 47th Saturn Awards, including a Best Director nomination.

Rajamouli's films are often characterized by their epic grandeur, larger-than-life characters, stylized action sequences, and unbridled heroism with historical and mythological references. His films are noted for their integration of CGI with practical effects. With his Baahubali films, he has pioneered the pan-Indian film movement, wherein a film is simultaneously released in multiple Indian languages across the country, and made in a way that appeals to the audience cutting across the linguistic and cultural barriers.[13][14][15] He is also credited for expanding the market of Telugu cinema and South Indian cinema into North India and international markets.[16][17][18]
